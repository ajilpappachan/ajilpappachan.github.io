    <h1 style="color: white;">Hi Nivi,</h1>

    <p style="font-size: larger; color: white;">Congratulations on solving the math puzzle. I knew it would be too easy
      for you. I am
      not good at arts and crafts as is evident from my lame letter. But what I am moderately good at is programming.
      But
      even for that I must thank you. You are the reason this virtual happy birthday card is possible. I learned how to
      use phaser engine so that I could do cute things for you. The fact that it can also help me expand my portfolio is
      a
      happy coincidence. Or Serendipity. I learned how to do so many things because of you. You are the best thing to
      ever
      happen to me. You are my happiness. Thank you for being in my life. I know you don't like it when I put too much
      effort into making something for you. And I know you feel upset thinking about how to repay me back. But Nivi...
      You
      already did. You gave me so much more than you can ever possibly know. And these cute things I do for you, that's
      me
      trying to repay you back the only way I know how. Thank you for always being there for me. Thank you for coming
      back
      to me always when we fight. I will never ever stop loving you. I will always do everything I can to take care of
      you. You are my mostest. I love you 3000.</p>

    <p style="font-size: larger; flex-wrap: wrap; color:white;">And on that note, let me present you with my birthday
      gift for you. I put together everything I know. And everything I learned because of you. And I did my best to give
      you something worthy of you. But to make it more interesting, I have kept it locked away. Given below is a button
      to collect your gifts. They are all in zip files which you have to extract to collect your gift. The name of each
      zip file is a clue or a question. The answer to that will be the password to open or extract the zip file. Solve
      and collect all your gifts to get a clue to the password of one small final gift. I hope you love these gifts as
      much as I enjoyed making them for you. Thank you for being an amazing friend, therapist and girlfriend. Thank you
      for being mine.<br>
      Sincerely only yours,<br>
      Aju.
